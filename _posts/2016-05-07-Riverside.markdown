Down by the river by the boats
在河邊的泊船處
Where everybody goes to be alone
人們都喜歡獨自前往
Where you won't see any rising sun
那是一個看不到日出的地方
Down to the river we will run
我們跑到那河邊
When by the water we drink to the dregs
在水邊暢飲
Look at the stones on the riverbed
看河牀上的石頭
I can tell from your eyes
我能從你的眼神中看出
You've never been by the riverside
你從未來過這河邊
Down by the water the riverbed
在水邊的河牀上
Somebody calls you somebody says
有人在呼喚，有人在私語
swim with the current and float away
順水遊走然後消失不見
Down by the river everyday
每天如此，在這河邊
Oh my God I see how everything is torn in the river deep
哦 上帝 我看到這一切如何在河中深處腐爛
And I don't know why I go the way
我不知道爲何依然執意前行
Down by the riverside
在那河邊
When that old river runs pass your eyes
當那條古老的河從你的眼前流過
To wash off the dirt on the riverside
洗盡河邊的污垢
Go to the water so very near
走到離水邊更近的地方
The river will be your eyes and ears
將更清晰地看到、更清楚地聽到這一切
I walk to the borders on my own
我獨自走到水的邊沿
fall in the water just like a stone
像一塊石頭一樣墜入河中
Chilled to the marrow in them bones
沒入徹骨的寒冷
Why do I go here all alone
爲何我要獨自前來
Oh my God I see how everything is torn in the river deep
哦 上帝 我看到這一切如何在河中深處腐爛
And I don't know why I go the way
我不知道爲何依然執意前行
Down by the riverside
在那河邊
Oh my God I see how everything is torn in the river deep
哦 上帝 我看到這一切如何在河中深處腐爛
And I don't know why I go the way
我不知道爲何依然執意前行
Down by the riverside
在那河邊
Oh ....
Oh ....
Oh ....
Down by the riverside
在那河邊
Down by the riverside
在那河邊
